          All modern websites and web applications are built using three
          fundamental technologies: <strong>HTML</strong>,
          <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong>. These are the
          languages of the web.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all
          about, and why you too should learn it.
        </p>

        <h3>Introduction to HTML</h3>

        <p>At its heart, HTML is a language made up of elements such like:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Paragraph</li>
          <li>Bulleted list</li>
          <li>Table</li>
          <li>Header</li>
          <li>Three columns of content</li>
          <li>A navigation menu</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Which can be applied to pieces of text to give them different meaning
          in a document, structure a document into logical sections, and embed
          content such as <em>images</em> and
          <em>videos</em>
          into a page.
        </p>

        <p>
          This module will introduce the first two of these and introduce
          fundamental concepts and syntax you need to know to understand HTML.
        </p>

        <h3>What is HTML?</h3>

        <p>
          HTML <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext
          <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage is the code that is
          used to structure a web page and its content.
        </p>

        <p>
          For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a
          list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables.
        </p>

        <p>
          As the title suggests,this article will give you a basic understanding
          of HTML and its functions.
        </p>

        <p>
          HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content.
        </p>

        <p>
          HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or
          wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way,
          or act a certain way.
        </p>
        <p>
          The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere
          else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so
          on.
        </p>
        <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            The opening tag &mdash; Consists of the name of the element wrapped
            in opening and closing angle brackets. It states where the element
            begins.
          </li>
          <li>
            The closing tag &mdash; This is the same as the opening tag, except
            that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This
            states where the element ends.
          </li>
          <li>
            The content &mdash; This is the content of the element, usually a
            text.
          </li>
          <li>
            The element &mdash; The opening tag, the closing tag, and the
            content together comprise the element.
          </li>
        </ol>
