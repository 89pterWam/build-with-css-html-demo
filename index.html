    <h2>The Basic Language of the Web: HTML</h2>

    <p>Posted by <strong>Paul Lulami</strong> on Monday, June 21st 2027</p>

    <p>
      All modern websites and web applications are built using three fundamental
      technologies: <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong> and
      <strong>JavaScript</strong>. These are the languages of the web.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about,
      and why you too should learn it.
    </p>

    <h2>Introduction to HTML</h2>

    <p>
      At its heart, HTML is a language made up of elements, which can be applied
      to pieces of text to give them different meaning in a document (Is it a
      <em>paragraph</em>? Is it a <em>bulleted list</em>? Is it part of
      <em>a table</em>?), structure a document into logical sections (Does it
      have a <em>header</em>? <em>Three columns of content</em>?
      <em>A navigation menu</em>?), and embed content such as
      <em>images</em> and <em>videos</em>
      into a page.
    </p>
    <p>
      This module will introduce the first two of these and introduce
      fundamental concepts and syntax you need to know to understand HTML.
    </p>

    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>

    <p>
      HTML <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup
      <strong>L</strong>anguage is the code that is used to structure a web page
      and its content.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a
      list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables.
    </p>

    <p>
      As the title suggests,this article will give you a basic understanding of
      HTML and its functions.
    </p>

    <p>HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content.</p>

    <p>
      HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap,
      different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a
      certain way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else,
      can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case,
        p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the
        element begins or starts to take effect â€” in this case where the
        paragraph begins.
      </li>
      <li>
        The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it
        includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the
        element ends â€” in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a
        closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to
        strange results.
      </li>
      <li>
        The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is
        just text.
      </li>
      <li>
        The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together
        comprise the element.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Why should you learn HTML?</h3>

    <p>
      There are countless reasons for learning the <em>fundamental</em> language
      of the web.Here are 5 of them:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>To be able to use the fundamental web dev language</li>
      <li>
        To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like
        Worpress or Wix
      </li>
      <li>To build web applications</li>
      <li>To impress friends</li>
      <li>To have fun ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Hopefully you learned something new here. See you next time!</p>
